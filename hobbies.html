            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        
            <div class="hobby-box">
                <h2>Chess</h2>
                <p>I have been interested in chess since 3rd grade. In 6th grade, I reached the division level, but unfortunately, I got eliminated. After that, my passion for chess faded.</p>
                <p>However, when I joined college, my interest in chess reignited. In my college sports fest, I made it to the semi-finals, which motivated me to improve my game. Next time, I will give my best and aim for the championship! ‚ôüüî•</p>

            <div class="hobby-box">
                <h2>Carrom</h2>
                <p>Carrom has always been a fun and exciting game for me. I enjoy the precision and strategy it requires, just like chess. Playing carrom helps me stay focused and improves my aiming skills.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="hobby-box">
                <h2>Video Editing and Videography</h2>
                <p>I have a deep passion for video editing and videography, as they allow me to capture moments creatively and tell compelling stories. From shooting videos to adding effects and transitions, I enjoy every part of the process.</p>
                <p>My skills in video editing helped me secure 1st place in the videography competition at my college sports fest, UDAAN‚Äô24. I covered various sports events and presented them in an engaging way. This experience further fueled my love for visual storytelling.</p>
                <p>I‚Äôm always eager to explore new techniques, improve my editing skills, and create even more impactful videos! üöÄüé•</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="hobby-box">
                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>Cooking is one of my biggest passions, especially when it comes to South Indian dishes. I love making crispy dosas with sambar, soft idlis with coconut chutney, and crunchy medu vadas. The flavors, the process, and the satisfaction of creating a perfect dish make cooking an enjoyable experience for me.</p>
                <p>Whenever I reach home, the first thing I do is take over the kitchen and tell my mom to step aside so I can cook. There's something truly special about preparing food with my own hands and enjoying every bite of it! üòÑüçΩÔ∏è</p>
